It does seem like we have a out-lier feature around the 7500 rentals count in our distribution.\nANALYZING NON TARGET FEATURES\n\nbikes %>%\n  keep(is.numeric) %>%\n  ggpairs()\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this graph, we can see how the different features in our data sets correlate to each other. We can see that tempature does have one graph that seems to be a linear correlation with an outlier in there. We can see that most of the graphs in a row do follow the same kind of pattern."
